# Java Quiz Manager - Basic Version
How to Use:
___
Once you launch the app, you will be asked to choose from a group of quizzes, 

some of them are open quizzes, others are MCQ. Type the number of the quiz you 
want to take and hit Enter! 
__
If you choose an Open Questions Quiz. You will be given a question, you need to 
enter the Answer in the console to move to the next question. 
You will also be 
notified of the difficulty of each question. 
Once you finish the questions of a quiz 
you will know how much you scored. 

___
If you choose an MCQ, you will be asked a question with 4 options to choose 
from. In this quiz you will type the number of the option that you think is correct 
as it appears on the console. As the open quiz you will go through all the 
questions and finally receive your score. 

___
A feature to update the questions was not added yet, but the quiz information, 
questions for each quiz and answers are stored in CSV files before theyâ€™re inserted 
into the h2 database. So you can change the quizzes simply by modifying the CSV 
files before launching the app. 
Hope you enjoy the App !
